# Media

This folder stores supporting visual evidence related to heat damage or ignition events. This includes photos, diagrams, thermal imagery, and other image-based documentation associated with case files, analysis, or literature.

Use this folder to keep media files organized and accessible without embedding large images directly into Markdown files.

## What belongs in this folder

- Photographs of suspected damage or burn patterns
- Reference images showing nearby reflective surfaces (e.g. window placements)
- Diagrams or illustrations of relevant site layouts or angles
- Infrared or thermal camera snapshots
- Side-by-side comparisons (before/after, shaded vs. unshaded)

## File Naming

Use clear, consistent file names that relate to the case or document they support.

**Examples:**

- `kennesaw-honda-panel.jpg`  
- `window-angle-diagram.png`  
- `thermal_reading_072808.jpg`  
- `comparison_before_after_element.jpg`

Avoid generic filenames like `image1.jpg`.

## Folder Organization

Media can be grouped in subfolders if needed (e.g. `media/honda-element-2009/`) to keep related images together. If a case report contains many images, itâ€™s helpful to keep them in a matching subfolder.

## Linking Media

Where possible, link or embed media in the associated Markdown file using standard syntax:

```markdown
![Panel damage near driver-side door](../media/kennesaw-honda-panel.jpg)
