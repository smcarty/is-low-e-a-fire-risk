# Contributions

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the *Is Low-E a Fire Risk?* project. We welcome all forms of thoughtful, evidence-backed participation.

## How to Contribute

We currently accept contributions through GitHub pull requests. If you're unfamiliar with GitHub, you're encouraged to:

- Pair up with someone who can assist in submitting your work
- Join the discussion in Issues to suggest ideas or flag questions
- Look out for future volunteer calls (see below)

Contributions may include:
- New case reports (see `/case-files/` and the `case-template.md`)
- Public datasets, fire overlays, or energy rebate data
- Scientific studies, thermal modeling, or field tests
- Visuals or maps that illustrate findings
- Peer review, metadata tagging, or formatting cleanup

Please keep each submission in its own clearly named file, and include:
- A brief description of what it is
- Source citations when possible
- Any visual aids or summaries that help interpretation

## Formatting Expectations

- Follow the folder structure described in `README.md`
- For new case files, use the structure in `case-template.md`
- Avoid overly large uncompressed files (e.g. videos or high-res TIFFs)
- Use plain language when possible
- Prefer accessible formats: `.md`, `.csv`, `.pdf`, `.png`, etc.

## Seeking Volunteers

This is a volunteer-driven project. If you’d like to help with:
- Reviewing and uploading submissions from non-coders
- Managing incoming case tips
- Organizing datasets or citations

...we’d love to hear from you! A formal intake process for volunteers will be developed as the project grows.
