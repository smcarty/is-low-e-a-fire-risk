# Is Low-E a Fire Risk?

An open-source risk assessment and collaborative research project exploring whether reflective Low-E (low-emissivity) windows contribute to exterior heat damage or ignition risk, including their potential role in wildfires.

---

## Purpose

This project aims to investigate reports that Low-E windows, while improving energy efficiency, may reflect intense solar heat that causes:

- Exterior ignition of nearby materials (e.g. mulch, siding, vinyl)
- Heat damage to vehicles (e.g. warped cladding or melted plastics)
- Increased risk of fire spread in wildlandâ€“urban interface zones

We are not assuming fault. This is an evidence-based assessment of risk that draws on real-world observations, temperature testing, building codes, and fire data. 

## Guiding Note

This project does not seek to discredit or demonize low-emissivity (low-E) windows, which play a valuable role in improving building efficiency and reducing energy use. Our aim is to explore whether unintended fire risks may arise in certain contexts, especially where concentrated reflections or material interactions occur. By investigating this carefully, we hope to inform safer designs and policies without undermining the broader benefits of sustainable technology.

## What This Repository Contains

-	*case-files/*
Documented incidents of heat damage or suspected ignition, such as melted cladding, scorched siding, or vegetation fires. Each file should include location, date (if known), material affected, observed damage, and photographic or witness evidence if available.
- *data-sources/*
Archival or public domain sources of raw information, including government fire maps, energy rebate records, construction permits, insurance payout datasets, and environmental data. This folder serves as a repository of inputs that support future analysis.
- *literature/*
Published research, technical specifications, white papers, fire safety bulletins, manufacturer documentation on reflective window coatings, and material temperature thresholds. Peer-reviewed or expert sources preferred.
- *media/*
Visual documentation, such as photographs of damage, screenshots of satellite imagery, or snapshots of suspected reflection paths. This folder is for standalone media, not raw datasets or analytical visualizations.
- *analysis/*
Custom-generated overlays, maps, scripts, statistical models, and correlation efforts. Examples might include GIS shapefiles comparing fire origins with housing developments using Low-E windows, or code analyzing fire ignition timing versus construction dates.
-	*contributions.md*
Guidelines for submitting new case files, sourcing public data, creating visual overlays, or contributing to the project through research, testing, or peer review. Includes formatting expectations and credit policy.

## Current Focus

- Collecting and documenting verified cases of localized heat damage
- Cross-referencing building age, window type, and environmental conditions
- Exploring possible links to fire ignition patterns after 2006, when Low-E windows became widespread

## Project Origin

This investigation began with firsthand observation of vehicle panel damage linked to concentrated solar reflection from nearby windows. As similar cases emerged, it raised a broader research question:

Are Low-E windows creating unintentional ignition risks in residential or high-fire-risk zones?

This repository serves as a public resource and data collection point to help answer that question.
