# Is Low-E a Fire Risk?

An open-source risk assessment and collaborative research project exploring whether reflective Low-E (low-emissivity) windows contribute to exterior heat damage or ignition risk, including their potential role in wildfires.

---

## Purpose

This project aims to investigate reports that Low-E windows, while improving energy efficiency, may reflect intense solar heat that causes:

- Exterior ignition of nearby materials (e.g. mulch, siding, vinyl)
- Heat damage to vehicles (e.g. warped cladding or melted plastics)
- Increased risk of fire spread in wildlandâ€“urban interface zones

We are not assuming fault. This is an evidence-based assessment of risk that draws on real-world observations, temperature testing, building codes, and fire data.

## What This Repository Contains

- `case-files/` - Documented heat damage or potential ignition events
- `data-sources/` - Public fire maps, insurance records, energy-efficiency rebate filings, and construction overlays
- `literature/` - Studies, fire department warnings, and technical specifications
- `media/` - Photo evidence (optional) of damage or suspected heat concentration
- `contributions.md` - Guidelines for submitting cases or participating in research

---

## Current Focus

- Collecting and documenting verified cases of localized heat damage
- Cross-referencing building age, window type, and environmental conditions
- Exploring possible links to fire ignition patterns after 2006, when Low-E windows became widespread

## Project Origin

This investigation began with firsthand observation of vehicle panel damage linked to concentrated solar reflection from nearby windows. As similar cases emerged, it raised a broader research question:

Are Low-E windows creating unintentional ignition risks in residential or high-fire-risk zones?

This repository serves as a public resource and data collection point to help answer that question.
