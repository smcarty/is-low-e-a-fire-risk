# Data Sources

This folder contains raw or processed data relevant to assessing potential links between low-emissivity (low-E) windows and heat damage or wildfire risk. All data should be from public or verifiable sources and should include enough detail to allow others to review, replicate, or build upon the analysis.

## What belongs in this folder

- **Fire maps and ignition data**  
  Example: U.S. Forest Service wildfire records, CAL FIRE ignition reports, or local incident databases.
  
- **Construction timelines**  
  Example: Housing permit datasets, year-built overlays, or public records indicating the construction era of homes.
  
- **Energy-efficiency rebates**  
  Example: Records from programs that subsidized low-E window installations, often available through state energy agencies or public utilities.
  
- **Insurance data (public)**  
  Example: Aggregated property damage reports, claim heatmaps, or published risk ratings tied to specific regions.
  
- **Weather and sunlight data**  
  Example: NOAA sun intensity records, heatwave reports, or UV index maps.

- **Zoning and housing overlays**  
  Example: GIS-compatible maps of subdivisions, neighborhoods, or zoning changes over time.

- **Other relevant public records**  
  Example: Sustainability programs, home improvement grant archives, or environmental review findings.

## Best Practices

- **Cite your sources clearly**, especially if the data is time-bound or region-specific.
- **Include a short note or README** with each file that explains what it is and how it was obtained.
- **Use formats others can open easily** (e.g., `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.geojson`, `.pdf`, `.md`).
- **Organize by region or topic**, if submitting multiple datasets.
- **Avoid uploading private or non-shareable files**. Only include data that others are legally allowed to use and share.
