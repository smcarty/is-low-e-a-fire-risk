**Title:** Homeowners, HOAs report damage to vinyl siding, fire hazards caused by Low-E windows  
**Publisher:** Independent American Communities

**Credibility:** Moderate–High (researched, issue-focused reporting by a housing rights advocate)

### Summary:
This article compiles reports and references from homeowners and housing associations (HOAs) across the U.S. experiencing property damage caused by **reflected sunlight from Low-E windows**. Incidents include **warped and melted vinyl siding**, **fire ignition in mulch beds**, and significant **inter-property disputes**—especially in dense housing developments.

The piece cites manufacturer disclaimers and **warranty exclusions** that explicitly deny coverage for damage caused by “external heat sources,” including reflected solar energy. It also references **code inconsistencies** across states and the lack of **mandated use of mitigating technologies** like capillary tubes.

The article connects individual cases to broader systemic gaps in construction regulation, HOA conflict resolution mechanisms, and legal liability ambiguity. The pattern of damage suggests a **known but underreported failure mode** of energy-efficient construction practices.

### Relevance to Project:
- Expands the list of documented cases involving reflected heat damage.
- Provides **language from vinyl siding manufacturer warranties** excluding Low-E heat damage.
- Highlights **conflict patterns** between neighbors and HOAs as Low-E use expands.
- Connects housing density and proximity to increased risk of thermal damage.
- Adds a housing advocacy voice to the broader conversation about safety and infrastructure design.
