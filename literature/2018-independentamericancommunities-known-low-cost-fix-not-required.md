### Summary:
This article compiles reports and references from homeowners and HOAs across the U.S. who’ve experienced property damage linked to **reflected sunlight from Low-E windows**. Documented damage includes:
- Warped and melted vinyl siding,
- Fire ignition in mulch beds,
- HOA disputes between neighbors whose homes reflect damaging beams.

The article also cites **warranty exclusions** from vinyl siding manufacturers that deny coverage for damage caused by “external heat sources”—effectively acknowledging the problem while deflecting liability.

One of the most striking points: the **existence of capillary tubes** as a **known, low-cost design fix** that prevents reflection-based damage. These tubes are mandated in high-elevation states due to air pressure regulation needs, but they’re **not required in most regions**, despite their broader safety benefits.

### Relevance to R-Low-E Project:
- Adds housing policy and HOA context to fire and damage cases.
- Provides **manufacturer-level documentation** of liability exclusions.
- Reinforces the case for **regulatory failure**: a known fix exists, yet it's not required.
- Highlights **real-world conflict** emerging from energy-efficiency mandates.
