### 🧪 Scientific Concern
> “Low-E windows can reflect and magnify sunlight in a way that can melt siding, plastic, and even parts of other buildings.”  
— *Dr. R. Thomas Gattiker*, Boise State University researcher studying this phenomenon.

Gattiker refers to the issue as potentially **“the next asbestos”** in terms of underrecognized harm with wide usage.

### 🔥 Real-World Cases
> “We’ve seen siding melted, car parts warped, patio furniture ruined. One man even told us the reflection set his mulch on fire.”  
— *Monica Laliberte*, WRAL investigative reporter

Multiple homeowners and neighbors reported damage to nearby homes and vehicles—not the homes with the windows, but those *adjacent to* Low-E installations.

---

### 🏢 Regulatory Gaps
> “Building codes require Low-E windows for energy efficiency, but do not account for collateral damage their reflections might cause.”  
The report highlights that Low-E windows are encouraged or mandated for **energy efficiency rebates**, yet there are **no safety testing standards** for reflected beam intensity.

---

### 🛠 Manufacturer Position
> Window manufacturers have responded by saying **installation angle and exterior materials** are responsible, not the windows themselves.  
This echoes the industry’s historical reluctance to acknowledge product externalities—important in your broader critique.
