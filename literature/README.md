This folder is for background research, official publications, and scientific or technical documents that help inform the risk analysis related to low-emissivity (low-E) window technologies and potential fire hazards.

You do not need to be the author of the document to include it, as long as it’s publicly available or properly cited.

Acceptable types of literature:
	1.	Peer-reviewed journal articles
(Example: studies on concentrated solar reflection or siding material thresholds)
	2.	Technical specifications
(Example: datasheets or engineering specs for low-E glass or plastic cladding)
	3.	Fire department advisories or warnings
(Example: local fire marshal notices related to heat reflection or window-related risks)
	4.	Energy efficiency program documents
(Example: rebate program PDFs or policy statements about low-E incentives)
	5.	Legal filings or insurance reports
(Example: cases or summaries involving window-related damage claims)
	6.	White papers or internal memos from manufacturers
(Only if publicly available or shared with permission)
	7.	News articles or investigative journalism
(Especially if the reporting is original and cites credible sources)
	8.	Academic theses or conference presentations
(When relevant to heat concentration, materials science, or wildfire ignition)
	9.	Government publications
(From agencies like the U.S. Fire Administration, NIST, DOE, or similar bodies)
	10.	International standards or safety guidelines
(Such as ISO, ASTM, or national fire safety codes)
11.	Other credible sources
If you find a relevant document that doesn’t fit any of the categories above but 
clearly supports the research goals of this project, please include it. Add a short 
note explaining why you believe it’s useful.

Submission notes:
	•	Name files clearly and include the source and date in the filename if possible
	•	If uploading a local file, add a short .md file summarizing its contents and origin
	•	You may also include links to online documents instead of uploading the file itself
	•	If the document is behind a paywall or login, please note that in the description

Important Note:
This project does not seek to discredit or demonize low-emissivity (low-E) window technologies. 
These windows contribute meaningfully to energy savings and climate resilience. The intent here 
is to understand whether specific environmental or material interactions — such as heat reflection 
in certain urban or wildfire-prone contexts — present risks that merit further study or mitigation.
Careful analysis allows us to improve safety without undermining valuable sustainability tools.
