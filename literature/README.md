## Literatur
This folder is for background research, official publications, and scientific or technical documents that help inform the risk analysis related to low-emissivity (low-E) window technologies and potential fire hazards.

You do not need to be the author of the document to include it, as long as it’s publicly available or properly cited.

#3 Acceptable types of literature:
 - Peer-reviewed journal articles
(Example: studies on concentrated solar reflection or siding material thresholds)
 - Technical specifications
(Example: datasheets or engineering specs for low-E glass or plastic cladding)
 - Fire department advisories or warnings
(Example: local fire marshal notices related to heat reflection or window-related risks)
 - Energy efficiency program documents
(Example: rebate program PDFs or policy statements about low-E incentives)
 - Legal filings or insurance reports
(Example: cases or summaries involving window-related damage claims)
 - White papers or internal memos from manufacturers
(Only if publicly available or shared with permission)
 - News articles or investigative journalism
(Especially if the reporting is original and cites credible sources)
 - Academic theses or conference presentations
(When relevant to heat concentration, materials science, or wildfire ignition)
 - Government publications
(From agencies like the U.S. Fire Administration, NIST, DOE, or similar bodies)
 - International standards or safety guidelines
(Such as ISO, ASTM, or national fire safety codes)
 - Other credible sources
If you find a relevant document that doesn’t fit any of the categories above but 
clearly supports the research goals of this project, please include it. Add a short 
note explaining why you believe it’s useful.

# Submission notes:
	•	Name files clearly and include the source and date in the filename if possible
	•	If uploading a local file, add a short .md file summarizing its contents and origin
	•	You may also include links to online documents instead of uploading the file itself
	•	If the document is behind a paywall or login, please note that in the description

# Important Note:
This project does not seek to discredit or demonize low-emissivity (low-E) window technologies. 
These windows contribute meaningfully to energy savings and climate resilience. The intent here 
is to understand whether specific environmental or material interactions — such as heat reflection 
in certain urban or wildfire-prone contexts — present risks that merit further study or mitigation.
Careful analysis allows us to improve safety without undermining valuable sustainability tools.
