This folder is for all in-depth investigations into whether and how low-emissivity (low-E) window installations may contribute to unintended heat concentration or fire risk. This includes statistical work, mapping, lab testing, or any form of technical analysis.

You do not need to be a coder to contribute. Any clear and well-documented investigation is welcome, including spreadsheets, lab notes, or field reports.

What belongs in this folder:
	1.	Statistical comparisons
(Example: fire frequency before and after low-E window installations)
	2.	Geographic overlays
(Example: comparing fire locations with housing construction year or rebate records)
	3.	Thermal or ignition modeling
(Example: testing how plastic siding or dry leaves respond to concentrated heat)
	4.	Timelines or pattern tracking
(Example: mapping ignition events over time alongside building trends)
	5.	Physical field tests or lab studies
(Example: temperature logs or plastic deformation reports)

Example filenames and their purpose:
	•	ignition-density-map.png: A visual map showing fire hotspots or risk zones
	•	plastic-melting-thresholds.md: Notes on temperatures where siding materials deform
	•	wildfire_timeline.xlsx: Spreadsheet comparing fire events with construction timelines
	•	thermal-reflection-study.pdf: A report on observed or modeled sunlight reflections
	•	R-values-vs-damage.md: Analysis comparing insulation benefits to potential heat damage
	•	SUMMARY.md: A plain-language summary of findings from your analysis

Best practices:
	•	Use clear, readable language
	•	Explain how you did your work (even if it’s a spreadsheet or notes)
	•	Cite data sources, especially if they’re in the data-sources folder
	•	Include visual aids or summaries when possible
	•	Keep each submission in its own file and name it clearly
