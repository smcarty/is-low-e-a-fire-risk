# Case Files

This folder contains individual case reports documenting observed or suspected instances of heat damage or ignition potentially linked to low-emissivity (low-E) window installations or other reflective surfaces.

These records provide real-world, anecdotal, or verified examples of damage to vehicles, buildings, or vegetation. The goal is to build a structured collection of reports that may help identify patterns or support further investigation.

Each case file should follow the `case-template.md` format and include:

## Required Information

- **Location**  
  Include city, state/province, and any relevant landmarks or coordinates (if safe to share).

- **Date**  
  Provide the date or estimated time period of the incident.

- **Material affected**  
  Describe the surface or object that was damaged (e.g. vehicle panel, vinyl siding, dry brush).

- **Observations and narrative**  
  Explain what happened, what was noticed, and any surrounding context that may be useful (e.g. sun angle, nearby windows or glass surfaces).

## Optional Additions

- **Photos**  
  Visual documentation of the incident or aftermath. Include captions or notes if helpful.

- **Temperature readings**  
  Any measured or estimated temperatures (including surface, ambient, or time-of-day context).

- **Witness statements or firsthand notes**  
  Include summaries or verbatim observations from people involved.

- **Follow-up**  
  If repairs were made or further testing was done, document any updates.

## Best Practices

- Stick to clear, descriptive file names (e.g. `kennesaw-ga-element-panel-2009.md`)
- One case per file; include supporting images or documents in the same folder using matching file names
- Cite sources if the report comes from a news story, public record, or online post
- Do **not** include personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, license plates, or home addresses
- Remain neutral and factual; avoid speculation or accusatory language
