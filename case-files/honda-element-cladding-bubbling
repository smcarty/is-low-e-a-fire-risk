Heat Damage to Plastic Cladding on Honda Element Due to Reflected Window Glare

Summary:
Plastic body panels on a 2006 Honda Element developed visible bubbling and deformation after repeated exposure to concentrated reflected sunlight from nearby high-efficiency windows (likely Low-E). While inspecting the damage, a hand held close to—but not touching—the surface experienced a sudden, painful burn on the back of the hand, indicating extreme localized air temperature or radiant heat from solar reflection.

⸻

Vehicle:
	•	Make/Model: 2006 Honda Element
	•	Configuration: Four-wheel drive, plastic cladding panels

Incident Location:
	•	Kennesaw, Georgia
	•	Residence was positioned such that reflected sunlight from neighboring reflective windows repeatedly hit the same area of the vehicle
	•	The problem developed during regular parking near a building equipped with high-efficiency (Low-E) reflective windows

Observed Damage:
	•	Localized bubbling and warping of exterior plastic cladding
	•	No rust or corrosion found beneath the surface
	•	Deformation attributed to thermal effects, not oxidation

Incident Details:
	•	Estimated Time Period: Between 2008 and 2010
	•	Season: Most likely late spring or summer, during peak sunlight exposure
	•	Touch Test:
	•	During a visual inspection of the bubbling, a hand was raised toward the affected panel
	•	Without making physical contact, the back of the hand was exposed to heat strong enough to cause pain and immediate withdrawal
	•	Resulted in a mild red spot similar to a flash burn
	•	Temperature felt comparable to placing skin near a hot stovetop

Notes:
	•	Damage remains visible as of 2025
	•	Replacement panels are difficult to source
	•	This incident demonstrates how concentrated solar reflection from Low-E windows can cause potentially dangerous localized heating, even outside the context of fire ignition.
	•	The Honda Element’s plastic cladding is likely made of ABS, which typically begins to soften at around 105 °C (221 °F) and deforms under sustained exposure to higher heat, making this bubbling consistent with intense solar concentration.
